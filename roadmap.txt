TODO:
*) dockerise variant calling
    --> DECIDE: now the variant calling takes the positions / variants of interest into account, but this makes implementing a pipeline for users more cunmbersome. should we just call all variants and do the filtering later?
*) argparse

general overview:
we need 2 files from the user:
*) a CSV file with variant IDs and means in the training data as the two columns
*) an exported Docker image (i.e. .tar file)

the pipeline will then
1.) get the relevant positions from the means CSV file
2.) use those in the variant calling pipeline and generate a CSV for the raw reads of a sample of interest
3.) the variants (i.e. features) in this file might not perfectly line up with the variants used by the model (which we got from the mean file)
    --> harmonize the variants (i.e. drop those not needed by the model and use the means for those needed by the model but missing in the sample CSV)
4.) the input CSV should now have the correct dimensions. run the docker image with the CSV file piped into its STDIN
